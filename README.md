- "Parodyk man vaizdą..." (Show me a picture...)

Followed by your description of what you'd like to see in the image. For example:
- "Sugeneruok nuotrauką su kalnų peizažu" (Generate a photo with a mountain landscape)
- "Sukurk paveikslėlį fantastinio miško" (Create an image of a fantasy forest)

The system uses Pollinations.AI API to create high-quality images based on your textual descriptions.
